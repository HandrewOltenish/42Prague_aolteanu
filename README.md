This is the repository for 42 courses. It contains projects from the Core Curriculum (the actual cursus for students). These are the current projects and the topics I have dealth with:
- libft (Personalization): creating personal library by replicating common functions from the standard C library.
- get_next_line (Optimization): printing one line at a time from a file descriptor without reading the entire file beforehand.
- born2beroot (Not present - Virtualiztion & System Administration): creating a Debian virtual machine, implementing strong password policies, and installing packages such as Uncomplicated FireWall, Wordpress, MariaDB, and lighttpd.
- ft_printf (Work In Progress) - Replicating a simple version of printf for common use and testing.
